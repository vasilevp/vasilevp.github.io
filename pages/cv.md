## Hobbies & interests

### Passionate hobbyist developer

I write code for all sorts of stuff without considering whether it would be useful for anything at all.
Some examples of things I wrote:

- a primitive operating system in [MASM]
- a formula parser for university studies
- a Monkey programming language parser, interpreter & VM compiler (following ["Writing An Interpreter In Go"](interpreterbook.com) & ["Writing A Compiler In Go"](https://compilerbook.com) two-part book by Thorsten Ball)
- a revised Monkey-like language parser & native x86 compiler using [GNU Flex], [GNU Bison] & LLVM
- a Minecraft-like voxel rendering engine/game (a 3D game in Go!)
- a pseudo-3D (Duke Nukem 3D, Doom 1 style) game with support for non-euclidean level geometry that runs on an [ESP32]
- a [Bell 202] modulator/demodulator that runs on an Arduino (makes the old-fashioned modem noises)
- software for an [APRS] ([Bell 202] + [AX.25]) ham radio weather station

### Electronics enthusiast

I like building cool things from electronic components that, again, aren't necessarily meant to be useful.

Some examples of things I built:

- a schedule-based camera with live YouTube streaming for watching my pet cockatiel
- a [Bell 202] [AX.25] serial sound modem
- an [APRS] ham radio weather station powered by an Arduino and a pocket radio
- an ATmega programmer powered by an Arduino
- multiple simple AM and FM radio receivers
- an FM radio transmitter
- a flower watering system with humidity sensor, Wi-Fi, and remote web access powered by an ESP-32
- a simplistic WAV player powered by an Arduino
- an LED-activated buzzer attachment for my washing machine to indicate that the washing cycle has finished or that user input (i.e., adding fabric softener) is required

### Less nerdy activities

I also like to play video games, cook, go camping, occasionally play guitar and bass, and write music.
